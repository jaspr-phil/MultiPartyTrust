# MultiPartyTrust

Trust and reputation are typically assessed using past interactions between agents. However, individual encounters may be part of complex overarching processes involving many interactions. In supply chain management, for example, numerous agents may be involved in sourcing raw materials, delivering them to manufacturing centres, and dispatching the final product to consumers. In such scenarios, the composition structure can affect interactions and the resulting utilities, as can the individual agents and services involved. Existing methods typically focus on aggregating assessments of individual agents and their capabilities, rather than analysing the structure of the composition. Such complex interactions can be described using workflows, defining a series of tasks to be performed, but a workflow may have multiple alternative paths and so the quality of the result can depend on a particular execution. A workflow can be defined by a set of provenance records, each representing one of its possible executions. In this paper, we propose a method for using graph mining and machine learning of the provenance records that collectively describe a workflow, and assess trust by aggregating estimates of execution utilities. We show that it is essential to consider the workflow structure in addition to its components to produce reliable trust assessments.
